The style here is that you need to complete a task to get to another stage starting from stage 0 so for me to get to stage 3, this is the task..
Teams were created and for you to join one, you need to advertise your hotel design which I did and Team Fury invited me to join their team and I did.
I helped with some little tasks like putting designers in same team together, suggestions and others.
Designs were picked so the front end guys can design it using coding. Mine was selected but for the sake that it was a competition mine was dropped due to little alignment issue.
We proceed to designing a Handwash reminder mobile App but this time was a group work.
Link to the design is below
